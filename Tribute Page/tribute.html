			<h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
			<section>
				Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 â€“ June 18, 2018), known professionally as XXXTentacion was an American rapper, singer, songwriter and musician. Although a controversial figure within the music industry, XXXTentacion has been regarded to have left behind "a huge musical footprint" due to his impact on his young fanbase and his popularity during his short career. He was often credited by critics and fans for his musical-versatility, with his music primarily exploring trap, R&B, rock and emo.<BR>

				Born in Plantation, Florida, XXXTentacion spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center[13] and started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013, where he soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s. XXXTentacion rose to mainstream fame with the single "Look at Me". His debut album, 17 (2017), debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and his second album, ? (2018), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Both albums have been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In the week following his death, XXXTentacion's highest-charting single, "Sad!", went from number 52 to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making him the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 posthumously since 1997.<BR>
